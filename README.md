# Movies-Admin-Panel
Built a web-based admin panel for managing a movie database system, enabling administrators to efficiently control and organize content such as movie details, categories, actors, and languages. The system integrates with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch real-time movie data, enhancing content accuracy and automation.
